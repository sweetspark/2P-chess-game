Objective: This is a Python program that lets two players play a game of chess on the console.

Chessboard: The chessboard is represented using a 2D grid of 8x8 cells. Each cell represents a position on the chessboard, and initial positions of white and black pieces are set up on the board.

Player Turns: The game alternates between two players. Player 1 controls the white pieces, and Player 2 controls the black pieces.

Moving Pieces: During their turn, a player can move one of their pieces to a different position on the chessboard. They need to provide the move in the format "from_position to_position" (e.g., "e2 e4").

Valid Moves: The program checks if the move is valid based on the rules of chess (e.g., piece-specific movement patterns, capturing opponent's pieces). If the move is not valid, the player is asked to try again.

Piece Types and Valid Moves: After making a move, the program displays the type of piece at the new position and the valid moves that piece can make in the next turn.

Checkmate Detection: The program currently has a placeholder for detecting checkmate (a winning condition in chess). However, the full checkmate logic is not implemented in this basic version.

Additional Commands: Players can use extra commands during their turn:

"exit": To exit the game.
"Print": To display the current state of the chessboard.
"<Position> --help": To check if a piece at a specific position can capture another piece.
Recording Moves: Each move made by the players is recorded in two ways:

In an Excel file named "chess_moves_log.xlsx".
In a text file named "chess_moves_log.txt".
Limitations: The game has some limitations:

It doesn't enforce all the rules of chess, such as pawn promotion, castling, and en passant.
Some piece-specific movement logic is not implemented (marked as "pass").
Customization: Developers can customize the code to add more features, rules, or advanced logic to enhance the game.

License: The code is licensed under the MIT License, allowing developers to use, modify, and distribute the code freely.

Acknowledgments: The code acknowledges the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model, which assisted in generating the README file.

Usage Instructions: The README file provides instructions on how to run the game and provides explanations for each step.

Contributions: Contributions from other developers are welcomed to improve the game.

Enjoyment: Players can enjoy playing the 2-player chess game with the provided functionalities and user interface.

Overall, this code serves as a simple implementation of a 2-player chess game with basic functionality and room for improvements and customization. It allows new readers to understand the game's flow, moves, and usage easily.
